Range queries are simple and popular types of queries used in data retrieval.
However, extracting exact and complete information using range queries is costly. 
As a remedy, some previous work proposed a faster principle, {\em approximate} search with range queries, also called single range cover (SRC) search. It can, however, produce some false positives. 
In this work we introduce a new SRC search structure, a $c$-DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which provably decreases the average number of false positives by logarithmic factor while keeping asymptotically same time and memory complexities as a classic tree structure. A $c$-DAG is  
a tunable augmentation of the 1D-Tree with denser overlapping branches ($c \geq 3$ children per node). We perform a competitive analysis of a $c$-DAG with respect to 1D-Tree and derive an additive constant time overhead and a multiplicative logarithmic improvement of the false positives ratio, on average. We also provide a generic machine learning (ML)  framework to extend our results to empirical distributions of queries, and demonstrate its effectiveness for Gowalla and NYC Yellow Taxi datasets. Finally, we discuss security and privacy aspects of SRC search on $c$-DAG vs 1D-Tree, mainly mitigation of structural leakage, which makes $c$-DAG a good data structure candidate for deployment in privacy-preserving systems (e.g., searchable encryption) and multimedia~retrieval.
